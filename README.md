### Overview
This repository highlights my work on various analytical projects within the marketing sector. Each project explores data to reveal insights and support data-driven decision-making. Some projects focus solely on data analysis, while others combine both analysis and machine learning techniques. Every project is organized in its own subfolder and typically includes but not limited to: project goals, tools and techniques used, insights and findings, links to code notebooks, optional presentation slides and visualizations.

Whether it's customer segmentation, campaign analysis, or predictive modeling, this repository reflects my approach to solving marketing challenges through data.

### Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis
- Objectives: This project aims to perform market campaign analysis using marketing data. 
- Content: The dataset contains information of the marketing campaign data of 2,240 customers of Maven Marketing, including customer profiles, product preferences, campaign successes/failures, and channel performance.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matpotlib, Seaborn, PowerPoint (for presentation).
- Techniques: Data exploration and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, marketing campaign analysis, time series analysis, data insights and recommendation.

- Outcome:
    * Low Campaign Acceptance: 92.5% of campaigns were unaccepted, indicating potential issues with targeting.
    * Spain has the highest rate of unaccepted campaigns, suggesting a mismatch between campaign content, or approach may not align with the preferences of Spanish customers
    * The majority of unaccepted campaigns are from customers born between 1970-1979. 
    * Married and cohabiting customers demonstrated minimal campaign engagement, indicating potential mismatches between campaign offers and their needs.
    * Higher-educated customers (graduates and PhD holders) exhibited significantly higher campaign rejection rates, suggesting preferences for tailored or value-added offers.
    * High-spending customers may be less responsive to the campaign.

- Recommendation:
    * Conduct surveys on focus groups to understand what they would value in a campaign.
    * Revise Campaign Strategy: Consider alternative campaign formats tailored for each customer group.
    * Since most of the customers are situated in Spain, customize campaigns for Spanish customers with localized offers and culturally relevant messaging.
